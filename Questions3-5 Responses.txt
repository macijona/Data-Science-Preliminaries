Question 3: If you were asked to impute null values in a column of a file that was 365 Gigabytes, what would you do?  What tools would you use?  What tools would you NOT use?
    Rather than reading the file and attempting to rectify the null values through python, I would attempt to import the files into a database and create a procedure to 
        rectify all values depending on the type of variable and amount of null values present in the variable.
    If the variable is a numerical, I would alter the null value to be a central value of the variable, such as the variable average or median.
    If the variable is categorical, I would alter the null value to the most frequently chosen value.
    If the variable is free-form (text) or there are not many records with missing values, I would simply discard the records. This is especcialy true if the amount of
        records to discard are tiny relative to the sheer amount of records in the file.


Quesiton 4:	What would you do if you were asked to do the above task every Thursday morning at 2:00am?
    If I was asked to do the above task every week, I would ask for the task to be rotated amongst the team every week. 
    If that was declined then I would kindly decline and ask to be given another task.

Quesiton 5: Who is your favorite mathematician, statistician or computer scientist and why?
    My favorite computer scientists is Edsger W. Dijkstra due to his vast contributions to computer science.
    I have heard his name for years accross many subdisciplines in computer science, and there is no doubt that his research has led to this computer dominated world.
    Some contributions are: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, one of the first programming langauges (ALGOL), solving the famed concurrency deadlock problem,
        and the paradigm of structured programming
